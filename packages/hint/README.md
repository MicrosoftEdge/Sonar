# webhint (`hint`)

## Quick start user guide

If you want to have an idea of what `webhint` does and you
have an updated version of `npm` (v5.2.0) and [Node.js LTS (v8.9.2)
or later, x64 version recommended][https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/]
you can use the following command:

```bash
npx hint https://example.com
```

Alternatively, you can install it globally with:

```bash
npm install -g --engine-strict hint

hint https://example.com
```

You can also install it as a `devDependency` if you prefer not to
have it globally (which is the team's preferred option).

**NOTE**: If you run into any issues during the install process
please check the [troubleshoot section](./troubleshoot/summary.md).
