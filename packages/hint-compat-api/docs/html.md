# Check for Deprecated HTML elements

## What does the hint check?

`compat-api-html` checks if the HTML elements and attributes used are
deprecated in the [targeted browsers][browser-context].

## Why is this important?

Deprecated HTML elements and attributes should not be used
as browsers may no longer provide support for them.
It can be tricky knowing when browser support for HTML elements
and attributes have been removed. This hint will check if you
are using HTML elements and attributes that have been deprecated.

### Examples that **trigger** the hint

The [blink][blink] element is deprecated and was removed in Firefox 22.
Targeting Firefox browsers of versions 22 and up will trigger the hint.

```html
<blink>Why would somebody use this?</blink>
```

The `scoped` attribute of the [style][style] element is deprecated
and was removed in Firefox 55. Targeting Firefox versions 55 and up
will trigger the hint.

```html
<style scoped>
    h1 {color:red;}
</style>
```

The global attribute [contextmenu][contextmenu] was removed from Firefox 56
for Android. Targeting Firefox for Android browsers of versions 56 and up
will trigger the hint.

```html
<body contextmenu="share"></body>
```

### Examples that **pass** the hint

The [div][div] element was never removed by any browser.
It should always pass the hint.

```html
<div></div>
```

The `method` attribute of the [form][form] element was never
removed for any browser. It should always pass the hint.

```html
<form method="get"></form>
```

The global attribute [class][class] was never removed for any browser.
It should always pass the hint.

```html
<div class="foobar"></div>
<p class="foobar"></p>
```

## Can the hint be configured?

This hint throws errors for HTML elements that have been deprecated in any
of the [targeted browsers][targeted-browsers] listed.

The targeted browsers can be defined in either the `.hintrc` or
`package.json` file.
This property follows the same convention as [browserslist][browserslist].

```json
{
    "browserslist": [
        "> 1%",
        "last 2 versions"
    ]
}
```

`ignore` can be used to specify a list of HTML features to be ignored. The
default value is `['integrity']`.

In the `.hintrc` file:

```json
{
    "connector": {...},
    "formatters": [...],
    "hints": {
        "compat-api/html": ["error", {
            "ignore": ["blink"],
        }],
        ...
    },
    ...
}
```

`enable` can be used to specify a list of HTML features to be checked even if
they are included in the ignore list. The default value is `[]`.

In the `.hintrc` file:

```json
{
    "connector": {...},
    "formatters": [...],
    "hints": {
        "compat-api/html": ["error", {
            "enable": ["integrity"],
        }],
        ...
    },
    ...
}
```
