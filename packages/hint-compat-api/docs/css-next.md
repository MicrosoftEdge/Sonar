# Check for CSS features that are not broadly supported

## What does the hint check?

`compat-api-css-next` checks if the CSS features used are
supported in the [targeted browsers][browser-context].

## Why is this important?

New CSS features are being implemented all the time. It's tricky knowing
when a feature has become standard among all browsers, when it needs a prefix,
and when it is not supported. This hint will check if you are using features
that are not supported by your targeted browsers, taking into account prefixes.

### Examples that **trigger** the hint

The [box-flex][box-flex] was
never added for any version of Internet Explorer. If Internet Explorer is
being targeted, using the `box-flex` property will trigger the hint.

```css
.example {
    box-flex: 1;
}
```

The `flex` value of the [display][display]
property was added for versions of Chrome 29 and onwards. Using `display: flex`
while targeting Chrome browsers of versions less than 29
will trigger the hint.

```css
.example {
    display: flex;
}
```

The at-rule [keyframes][keyframes] was added for versions of
Chrome 43 and onwards. Using `@keyframes`
while targeting Chrome browsers of versions less than 43
will trigger the hint.

```css
@keyframes name {
    0% {
        left: 0%;
    }
}
```

The prefixed `flex` value of the
[display][display]
property was added for versions of Chrome 21 and onwards.
Using `display: -webkit-flex` while targeting Chrome browsers of
versions less than 21 will trigger the hint.

```css
.example {
    display: -webkit-flex;
}
```

### Examples that **pass** the hint

The [charset][charset]
at-rule was added from Chrome version 2. It should pass the hint for
versions of Chrome from 2 onwards.

```css
@charset "UTF-8";
```

The [box-flex][box-flex] property
was added with prefixes for Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Safari.
[MDN compat data][browser-compat] does not specify which versions
they were added in, asserting that the property is supported with
prefixes, regardless of version. If `box-flex` is used with prefixes,
it should pass the hint for these browsers.

```css
.example {
    -webkit-box-flex: 0;
    -moz-box-flex: 0;
}
```

The `capitalize` property of [text-transform][text-transform]
does not have any information about when it was added to various browsers
according to the  [MDN compat data][browser-compat]. No error is thrown
if there is no information available on when, or if, the feature was added.

```css
.example {
    text-transform: capitalize;
}
```

## Can the hint be configured?

This hint throws errors for CSS features that are not supported in any of the
[targeted browsers][targeted-browsers] listed.

The targeted browsers can be defined in either the `.hintrc` or
`package.json` file.
This property follows the same convention as [browserslist][browserslist].

```json
{
    "browserslist": [
        "> 1%",
        "last 2 versions"
    ]
}
```

`ignore` can be used to specify a list of CSS features to be ignored. The
default value is `['cursor']`.

In the `.hintrc` file:

```json
{
    "connector": {...},
    "formatters": [...],
    "hints": {
        "compat-api/css-next": ["error", {
            "ignore": ["border-radius", "box-lines"],
        }],
        ...
    },
    ...
}
```

`enable` can be used to specify a list of CSS features to be checked even if
they are included in the ignore list. The default value is `[]`.

In the `.hintrc` file:

```json
{
    "connector": {...},
    "formatters": [...],
    "hints": {
        "compat-api/css-next": ["error", {
            "enable": ["cursor"],
        }],
        ...
    },
    ...
}
```
