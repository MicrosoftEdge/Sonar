                To find the number of `hops` we look into the `redirects` `Map` which should look similar to:

                | key  | value |
                |------|-------|
                | url2 | url1  |
                | url3 | url2  |
                | url4 | url3  |

                `targetUrl` is initially `url4` (the url for what we got the response for). We make our way
                up until `url1`. When we check if `url1` has any redirect, we don't find anything so we
                know we've reached the original `resourceUrl` and we can stop looking.
                Because `hops` always contains the latest url, we `pop` to have the intermediate requests.
