* Commit messages

Commit messages should look similar to the following structure:

----

Capitalized, short (50 chars or less) summary
<blank line>
More detailed explanatory text, if necessary, srapped to about 72
characters or so.

The commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed bug"
or "Fixes bug."  This convention matches up with commit messages
generated by commands like git merge and git revert.

At the end, I usually write where the users can find more info
(URL(s) or other related issues) and/or what this commit fixes.

(I also add a dotted line (e.g.: 1, 2) before the following)

Ref URL or <issue/issue comment>
Fix #<issue>

* How to PR

A PR might contain multiple commit, but usually a commit should be doing just one thing.

To complete.
