## Quick start user guide

Once you have [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/)
v8.x on your machine, you can use `npx` or install `sonarwhal` globally
to use it.

### Using `npx`

Run the following command:

```bash
npx sonarwhal https://example.com
```

This will start the wizard to create a `.sonarwhalrc` file, and then
analyze `https://example.com`.

**Windows users**: Currently [`npx` has an issue in this
platform](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/17869).

### Installing `sonarwhal` globally

```bash
npm install -g --engine-strict sonarwhal
```

Create a `.sonarwhalrc` file by running this command and following the
instructions:

```bash
sonarwhal --init
```

Scan a website:

```bash
sonarwhal https://example.com
```

To use a different formatter than the one specified in your `.sonarwhalrc` file
 you can do the following:

```bash
sonarwhal https://example.com --formatters excel
```

To use a different rule than the one specified in your `.sonarwhalrc` file:

```bash
sonarwhal https://example.com --rules html-checker
```

Multiple rules can be specified as a comma sepreated string:

```bash
sonarwhal https://example.com --rules axe,html-checker
```

For more in depth information on how to get started, configurations,
and more, see the online [user guide](https://sonarwhal.com/docs/user-guide/),
or the [local version](./packages/sonarwhal/docs/user-guide/index.md)
for the most recent (and unstable) content.
