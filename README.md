## Quick start user guide

Once you have [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/)
v8.x on your machine, you can use `npx` or install `webhint` globally
to use it.

### Using `npx`

Run the following command:

```bash
npx hint https://example.com
```

This will start the wizard to create a `.hintrc` file, and then
analyze `https://example.com`.

**Windows users**: Currently [`npx` has an issue in this
platform](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/17869).

### Installing `webhint` globally

```bash
npm install -g --engine-strict hint
```

Create a `.hintrc` file by running this command and following the
instructions:

```bash
hint --init
```

Scan a website:

```bash
hint https://example.com
```

To use a different formatter than the one specified in your `.hintrc` file
 you can do the following:

```bash
hint https://example.com --formatters excel
```

To use a different hint than the one specified in your `.hintrc` file:

```bash
hint https://example.com --hints html-checker
```

Multiple hints can be specified as a comma sepreated string:

```bash
hint https://example.com --hints axe,html-checker
```
