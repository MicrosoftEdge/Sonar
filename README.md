## Quick start user guide

Once you have [`Node.js`][node] v8.x on your machine, you can use
[`npx`][npx] or install `hint` globally to use it.

### Using `npx`

Run the following command:

```bash
npx hint https://example.com
```

This will analyze `https://example.com` using the default configuration.

### Installing `webhint` globally

```bash
npm install -g --engine-strict hint
```

Create a `.hintrc` file by running this command and following the
instructions:

```bash
npm create hintrc
```

Scan a website:

```bash
hint https://example.com
```

To use a different formatter than the one specified in your `.hintrc`
file you can do the following:

```bash
hint https://example.com --formatters excel
```

To use a different hint than the one specified in your `.hintrc` file:

```bash
hint https://example.com --hints html-checker
```

Multiple hints can be specified as a comma sepreated string:

```bash
hint https://example.com --hints axe,html-checker
```

For more in depth information on how to get started, configurations,
and more, see the online [user guide][user guide], or the [local
version][local user guide] for the most recent (and unstable) content.
