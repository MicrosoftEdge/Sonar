## Quick start user guide

Once you have [`Node.js`][node] (v8.x or later) on your machine, you can use
[`npx`][npx] to test it.

### Testing with `npx`

Run the following command:

```bash
npx hint https://example.com
```

This will analyze `https://example.com` using the default configuration.

### Installing `webhint` locally

Install webhint as a `devDependency` of your project:

```bash
npm install hint --save-dev
```

And then add a script task to your `package.json`:

```json
{
    ...
    "scripts": {
        "webhint": "hint"
    }
}
```

And run it via:

```bash
npm run webhint -- http://localhost:8080
```

Or if you are using `yarn` you can skip the step to create a task and
run directly:

```bash
yarn hint http://localhost:8080
```
